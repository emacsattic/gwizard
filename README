gwizard
-------

gwizard is a set of emacs-lisp macros, designed to help you with
Gtk+/GNOME/Bonobo programming, by generating all the boring
boilerplate code.

For installation notes, please consult the gwizard.el file.

gwizard comes with an article on how to use it to generate Bonobo
boilerplate code in doc/bonobo. It's in LaTeX format, so you'll need
that to actually read it nicely typeset. If you can't/won't do that,
you can look at the same article online:
http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/projecten/bonobo-gwizard/

The example discussed in the
article can be found in doc/bonobo/moody-component.
